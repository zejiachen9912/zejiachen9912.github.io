<h4 style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.25em">About</h4>

Welcome! I am a strategy consultant, digital marketing specialist, and data/computer science enthusiast with deep understanding in data analytics, strategic operation, and advertisement technology.

I recently received my BS degree in Quantitative Science at **Emory University** with a secondary major in Film & Media Study, and currently working as a Corporate Strategy Analyst at **Humana**, where I partner with executives across the organization to help define the future trajectory of the company.

As a connoisseur in fashion, I assisted with the birth of *Divine Mercy* (now [tribeplus](https://twitter.com/tribeplus)), an accessible streetwear brand aimed to promulgate western street culture in China.
I also buy, sell and trade vintage, archival designer garments every now and then.

<h4 style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.25em">Interest & Writing</h4>

Outside of work, I enjoy doing sports (tennis, boxing, hiking snowboarding), traveling, reading, and film photography.

Being a Cin√©philie, I love watching, analyzing, and commenting about films and television series. Some of my favorite film eras include: classic Hollywood, New Waves, and Italian Neorealism. Feel free to check out [my blog](blog/category/film/) where I share my idea and point of view on particular films.

I also have keen interest in machine/statistical learning as well as finance and investment. You can view some of the thoughts, notes that I jotted down as my learning journey continues.
