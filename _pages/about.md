<h4 style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.25em">About</h4>

Welcome! I am a strategy consultant, healthcare specialist, and data/computer science enthusiast with a deep understanding of enterprise strategic planning, US payor & provider operation, and data analytics.

I recently received my BS degree in Quantitative Science from **Emory University** double majored in Film & Media Study, and currently work as a Corporate Strategy Consultant at **Humana**, where I partner with senior leaders across various LOBs to chart the course of the company's key strategic initiatives.

As a fashion connoisseur, I helped create *Divine Mercy*, an accessible streetwear brand that aims to bring Western street culture to China. I also buy, sell and trade vintage and archival designer clothes every now and then.

<h4 style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.25em">Interests & Writing</h4>

Outside of work, I enjoy sports (tennis, boxing, hiking, snowboarding), traveling, reading, and film photography.

Being a Cin√©philie, I love to watch, analyze, and comment on movies and TV series. Some of my favorite film eras are: Classic Hollywood, New Waves, and Italian Neorealism. Feel free to check out my my [blog](blog/category/film/) where I share my ideas and point of view on certain movies.

I also have a keen interest in machine/statistical learning and its application to finance and healthcare. You can view some of the thoughts and notes I have jotted down as my learning journey continues.
