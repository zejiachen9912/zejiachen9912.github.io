I use this template as a repository for my personal items (mainly clothes) to keep track of information I would like to have in mind, like what I bought, how much I bought it for, and most importantly, how much I should sell it for to break even.

You can access the database as well as the comprehensive user manual by clicking [this link](https://immediate-dawn-dda.notion.site/Personal-Inventory-Template-288c3972db3a4d868ee7733f1cdfc8be?pvs=4).

Feel free to borrow the template if you find it useful, and let me know if you have any additional feedback.
